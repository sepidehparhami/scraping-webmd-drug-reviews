# Scraping WebMD Drug Reviews
This repository consists of unstructured text reviews, categorical ratings, and demographics from patients and caregivers of patients on various psychiatric drugs plus the scripts used to scrape reviews and provide an overview of the dataset. The data was scraped from WebMD on March 11, 2024. The current version of the dataset contains over 62,000 reviews for hundreds of medications used to treat psychiatric disorders. The list of medications to include was compiled using the search by condition function for WebMD's drug database. The conditions included are "depression," "anxiety", "anxiety with depression," "bipolar disorder," and "schizophrenia." Future updates will expand the dataset to include reviews added to WebMD since the last release of the dataset.

The dataset and description of the dataset are also available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sepidehparhami/psychiatric-drug-webmd-reviews.
