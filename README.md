# Scraping WebMD Drug Reviews
This repository consists of unstructured text reviews, categorical ratings, and demographics from patients and caregivers of patients on various psychiatric drugs and scripts used to scrape reviews and provide an overview of the dataset. The data was scraped from WebMD on March 8, 2024. The current version of the dataset contains nearly 30,000 reviews for 47 drugs used to treat depression, as found on WebMD's list at https://www.webmd.com/depression/depression-medications-antidepressants. Future updates will expand the list of drugs to include medications used for other psychiatric conditions and will include reviews added to WebMD since the last release of the dataset.

The dataset and description of the dataset are also available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sepidehparhami/psychiatric-drug-webmd-reviews.
