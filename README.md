# Scraping WebMD Drug Reviews
### Description
This repository consists of unstructured text reviews, categorical ratings, and demographics from patients and caregivers of patients on various drugs plus the scripts used to scrape reviews and provide an overview of the dataset. There are currently 3 sets of reviews available - 62,000 for psychiatric medication, 35,000 for hypertension medication, and 14,000 for diabetes medication. The datasets and dataset descriptions are also available on Kaggle. The data was scraped from WebMD on March 11, 2024.  The list of medications to include was compiled using the search by illness function for WebMD's drug database, accessible at https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/conditions/index. Future updates will expand the dataset to include reviews added to WebMD since the last release of the dataset.
